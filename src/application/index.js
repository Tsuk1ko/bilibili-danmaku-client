 * ApplicationConnection uses event 'message' instead of 'event' to notify the

 * This is because ApplicationConnection extends BaseConnection. Meanwhile,
 * the 'event' event is defined in DanmakuClient, which is a thin wrap over
 * ApplicationConnection.
 * And since ApplicationConnection only supports the Client side, the Event-to-JSON
