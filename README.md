## Introduction

Never heard of Bilibili or Danmaku? You're out of this. Close this page and have a cup of coffee might be the wise choice.

And if you're finding a way to watch on a Bilibili Live room, analyze danmaku programmatically, either for statistical or some squeaky purposes, you've come the right place. `bilibili-danmaku-client` will be exactly what you want.

`bilibili-danmaku-client` is a `npm` package that runs in Node.js or in the browser, providing an easy, fluent API for listening to the activities happening in a Bilibili Live room.

## Installation

It can't be easier to install a `npm` package.

First make sure that you have `npm` and `node` correctly installed and in `PATH`, and then:

```console
npm install --save bilibili-danmaku-client
```

If you see something like `peer dependencies not installed`, don't panic, see [this sector](#usage-in-browser) below.

## Usage

> If you wonder what you can do with this package, please see this [demo](https://std4453.github.io/bilibili-danmaku-client) first.

`bilibili-danmaku-client` is easy to use. You can:

### Open a connection

```javascript
const DanmakuClient = require('bilibili-danmaku-client');
// https://live.bilibili.com/5440
const client = new DanmakuClient(5440);
client.start();
```

### Listen to Events

```javascript
const client = ...;

const onDanmaku = ({ content, sender }) =>
    console.log(`${sender.name}: ${content}`);
const onGift = ({ gift, num, sender }) =>
    console.log(`${sender.name} => ${gift.name} * ${num}`);

client.on('event', ({ name, content }) => {
    switch (name) {
    case 'danmaku':
        onDanmaku(content);
        break;
    case 'gift':
        onGift(content);
        break;
    }
})
```

For more information about __Events__, see [Wiki](https://github.com/std4453/bilibili-danmaku-client/wiki/Events).

### Listen to client lifecycle

```javascript
const client = ...;
client.on('open', () => console.log('Client opened.'));
client.on('close', () => console.log('Client closed.'));
```

### Terminate client

```javascript
const client = ...;
client.terminate();
client.on('close' () => console.log('Client closed.'));
```

Note that you must listen to the `'close'` event to be notified when the client is actually closed. `terminate()` only requests close, not forces it.

For more information about how to use `DanmakuClient`, see [Wiki](https://github.com/std4453/bilibili-danmaku-client/wiki/DanmakuClient).

## Usage in browser

Actually this is not about `bilibili-danmaku-client` itself, but about the `x-platform-ws` package, which `bilibili-danmaku-client` depends on, and is a small utility package of mine.

In order to be compatible both in Node.js and in the browser, `x-platform-ws` requies shimming of the `buffer` and `events` Node.js module, therefore it declares them as [_peer dependencies_](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/). So if you run `npm install`, you might hear it complain about not installed peer dependecies.

Don't panic. That's perfectly unproblematic if you're only using `bilibili-danmaku-client` in Node.js, as shimming is not required there. But if you tend to use the package in a browser, you should read on.

I recommend using a bundler like [browserify](https://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). they will automatically detect usage of `buffer` and `events` and provide shimming. Unfortunately, I happen to have no knowledge about how to use this package without a bundler, so - you have to figure the solution out yourself.

## Development

To build and test the package yourself:

1. Clone the github repository

```console
git clone -b master https://github.com/Tsuk1ko/bilibili-danmaku-client.git
```

2. Build

```console
npm install && npm run build
```

3. Test

```console
npm test
```
